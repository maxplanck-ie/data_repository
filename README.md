This repository contains the Makefiles and associated scripts used to create the /data/repository institute-wide mount point. This repository should provide a means of version control, since global functions are typically used within these.

Note that many of the Makefiles within the `organisms/` subfolder will need to be renamed. For example, `Makefile_dm3_ensembl` would become `dm3_ensembl/Makefile`.

It should also be noted that this project makes use of files from https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings.
